        "content": "Earlier this year, IVP general partner Tom Loverro,proclaimedthat the post-pandemic downturn is over, and companies that made it this far should prioritize growth over cost-cutting. Yet, the companies still struggling to raise their next round of financing at a higher valuation or survive altogether could still be in the thousands, according to Brian Hirsch, co-founder of Tribeca Venture Partners. The 13-year-old firm has a late-stage strategy that, unlike conventional growth funds, invests in companies forced to raise capital at a valuation that’s the same or lower than their last price. In many of these situations, existing investors are ready to support the company with additional funding, but they need a third party like Tribeca Ventures to value the deal, Hirsch told TechCrunch. VCs are excited to back AI companies at red-hot valuations, “but everything else is really challenged,” Hirsch said. Nothing proves more just how much of a tale of two cities venture has become than the latest valuation data from Carta. The cap-table management platformanalyzed nearly 2,000 softwaredeals that closed this year and found that the bottom 10% of Series B deals had a pre-money valuation of only $40 million, meanwhile, the top 10% of companies at the same stage of development were priced at almost $1 billion. The price dispersion was even more stark for Series D deals, ranging from a mere $27 million to $5.2 billion. The companies at the upper end of the range are undoubtedly doing something having to do with AI.  Notable examples includeElevenLabs, which raised a $920 million Series B earlier this year, valuing the company at $920 million pre-money,andCohere, which closed its Series D at a $5 billion pre-money valuation. For non-AI startups, the fundraising landscape is drastically different, even if they raised capital after the ZIRP-era frenzy subsided. Non-AI companies that raised a Series A round 18 months ago are likely facing challenges in securing Series B funding, even with decent revenue growth, Hirsch said. Founders of non-GenAI startups must feel like “in high school, and they didn’t get invited to the cool party,” he said, adding that they often have a good business, but nobody cares. Indeed, Carta’s data reveals thatonly 9% of Series Acompanies have been able to secure Series B funding within two years, a significant decline from the previous 25%. However, Tribeca Ventures is using its growth fund to help pricedown roundsof more mature startups, primarily companies that have revenues of $20 million or above. Many of these startups are growing at a decent pace, but their valuations are too high for the current market. “We’re still in that unwinding process,” Hirsch said. “We think it’s at least a couple years more clean-up work.”"

        "content": "Grammarly is acquiring productivity startup Coda, the companyannouncedon Tuesday. As part of the deal, Coda’s CEO and co-founderShishir Mehrotrawill become the new CEO of Grammarly. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The acquisition will help turn Grammarly’s AI assistant into an “AI productivity platform” thanks to the addition of Coda’s AI tools and products, the company says. The deal will give Grammarly customers access to new features, such as generative AI chat and a productivity suite, to help them work more efficiently. Grammarly’s current CEO, Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, saidin a statementthat he is stepping down from his role and that he will work alongside Mehrotra as an adviser. Mehrotra, a 25-year tech veteran who previously served as YouTube’s chief product officer and chief technology officer, outlined his vision for Grammarly in ablog post: to make the AI assistant even smarter and more helpful. “Imagine if the Assistant not only gave amazing suggestions and refinements based on the writing it sees today but also had permission-aware connections into all of your other systems (from your email to docs to CRM to project trackers and more),” Mehrotra wrote. In addition, Coda’s core product, Coda Docs, will be upgraded with the Grammarly Assistant. “In the longer term, we plan to weave the best of Coda and Grammarly together,” Mehrotra wrote. “It will combine your company knowledge, generative AI chat features, a full productivity suite, and hundreds of agents to help you work smarter. We aim to redefine productivity for the AI era.” Founded in 2009, Grammarly has 40 million active users and isvalued at $13 billion. Coda was valued at $1.4 billion following itsSeries D raiseback in 2021. As AI assistants become more and more accessible, Grammarly’s acquisition of Coda will help it become better positioned to compete with companies building AI tools for writing and productivity."

        "content": "A San Francisco jury has found Nima Momeni guilty of second-degree murder in the stabbing of Bob Lee, the Cash App creator and former CTO of Block, according toNBC Bay Areaon Tuesday. The jury found Momeni not guilty of first-degree murder, meaning jurors decided the murder of Lee was not premeditated. Lee wasfatally stabbedon the streets of downtown San Francisco in April 2023. During the trial, prosecutors painted a dramatic picture of Lee’s two-day drug binge with Khazar Momeni, the sister of his murderer, which preceded his death. Prosecutors alleged that Lee’s friend and drug dealer had sexually assaulted Khazar during the escapade, leading to a heated exchange in which Nima ultimately stabbed Lee with a kitchen knife from his sister’s home. However, the defense told a different story. Nima Momeni told the jury he was out on a walk with Lee under the Bay Bridge on the night of the stabbing, trying to convince Lee to spend more time at home with his family instead of out partying. The defense alleged that Lee became frustrated and attacked Momeni with a knife during that conversation, leading Momeni to retaliate in self-defense and grab the weapon from Lee. Momeni told jurors he had no animosity toward Lee. However, video evidence of the event indicated that Momeni was the aggressor, and forensic testing found Momeni’s DNA on the knife’s handle. The punishment for first-degree murder is often harsher than the punishment for second-degree murder, but both typically come with lengthy prison sentences. Momeni is facing 16 years to life in prison, with sentencing to come at a later date. Lee was 43 and the chief product officer at the cryptocurrency company MobileCoin at the time of his death. Prior to that, he led technology development at Jack Dorsey’s Block, where he created the mobile payment service Cash App, and was also an investor in SpaceX, Clubhouse, Tile, and Figma. In his early 20s, he helped develop the Android operating system at Google. At the time of Lee’s death, his colleagues and peers praised his contributions to the technology world. The CEO of Figma, Dylan Field, noted howLee first met with him when he was 14and was an early supporter of Figma. Dorsey said Lee wasinstrumental to creating Square, which then became Block. Initially after Lee’s murder, many speculated that the tech executive’s death was random and related to San Francisco’s homelessness and crime problem. In fact, it turned out that Lee knew the killer."

TechCrunch Fintech scribe Mary Ann Azevedo will be back in your inbox on January 7. ❄️ How stablecoin technology can power billions in cross-border transactions Juicyway is an African fintech that’s leveraging stablecoin technology to power fast and cheap cross-border payments. The company launched out of stealth after processingover $1 billion in transaction volumefor thousands of African businesses over the last three years. The company claims to have processed over 25,000 transactions, generating $1.3 billion in total payment volume from 4,000 users. According to its founders, Juicyway racked up these numbers with no publicly available app or marketing efforts — and instead relied heavily on word-of-mouth referrals. One customer type for a cross-border payments platform would be a remittance business, but Juicyway is representative of a new wave of platforms powered by stablecoin technology that challenges the conventional methods across developed and emerging markets. Mynt has raised €22 millionin a round led by Vor Capital.Mynt has now raised around €50 million in total, and from what we understand, this funding values the company at roughly €200 million.

        "content": "OpenAI says it has no plans to release an API forSora, its AI model that can generate reasonably realistic videos when provided with a text description or reference image. During an AMA with members of OpenAI’s dev team, Romain Huet, head of developer experience at OpenAI, said that a Sora API isn’t in the cards at the moment. “We don’t have plans for a Sora API yet,” hewrote. The reason could be capacity issues. OpenAI was forced to close applications for its Sora-powered video creation and editing suite shortly after its launch due to heavier-than-anticipated traffic. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman apologized on X. Sora, one prompt, cinematic AFpic.twitter.com/X8gzdes20M — Alex Patrascu (@maxescu)December 14, 2024  “We significantly underestimated demand for Sora,” hewrote. “It’s going to take a while to get everyone access. Trying to figure out how to do it as fast as possible!” OpenAI resumed sign-ups for Sora several days ago. Choosing not to prioritize an API for Sora threatens to put OpenAI at a disadvantage compared to one of its chief rivals, Google, which launched an API in limited access for its video-generation model,Veo, in early December. Google said this week that Veo’s successor,Veo 2, which went viral for its impressively high-quality outputs, will get an API sometime in 2025. AWS has an API for its recently launchedNova Reelvideo model. And anumberofstartupsfocused on generative video offer APIs for their models. One firm, Runway,claimsthat its API has been used by “the world’s largest consumer technology companies to reliably generate millions of videos for their users.”"
