        "content": "Earlier this year, IVP general partner Tom Loverro,proclaimedthat the post-pandemic downturn is over, and companies that made it this far should prioritize growth over cost-cutting. Yet, the companies still struggling to raise their next round of financing at a higher valuation or survive altogether could still be in the thousands, according to Brian Hirsch, co-founder of Tribeca Venture Partners. The 13-year-old firm has a late-stage strategy that, unlike conventional growth funds, invests in companies forced to raise capital at a valuation that\u2019s the same or lower than their last price. In many of these situations, existing investors are ready to support the company with additional funding, but they need a third party like Tribeca Ventures to value the deal, Hirsch told TechCrunch. VCs are excited to back AI companies at red-hot valuations, \u201cbut everything else is really challenged,\u201d Hirsch said. Nothing proves more just how much of a tale of two cities venture has become than the latest valuation data from Carta. The cap-table management platformanalyzed nearly 2,000 softwaredeals that closed this year and found that the bottom 10% of Series B deals had a pre-money valuation of only $40 million, meanwhile, the top 10% of companies at the same stage of development were priced at almost $1 billion. The price dispersion was even more stark for Series D deals, ranging from a mere $27 million to $5.2 billion. The companies at the upper end of the range are undoubtedly doing something having to do with AI.\u00a0 Notable examples includeElevenLabs, which raised a $920 million Series B earlier this year, valuing the company at $920 million pre-money,andCohere, which closed its Series D at a $5 billion pre-money valuation. For non-AI startups, the fundraising landscape is drastically different, even if they raised capital after the ZIRP-era frenzy subsided. Non-AI companies that raised a Series A round 18 months ago are likely facing challenges in securing Series B funding, even with decent revenue growth, Hirsch said. Founders of non-GenAI startups must feel like \u201cin high school, and they didn\u2019t get invited to the cool party,\u201d he said, adding that they often have a good business, but nobody cares. Indeed, Carta\u2019s data reveals thatonly 9% of Series Acompanies have been able to secure Series B funding within two years, a significant decline from the previous 25%. However, Tribeca Ventures is using its growth fund to help pricedown roundsof more mature startups, primarily companies that have revenues of $20 million or above. Many of these startups are growing at a decent pace, but their valuations are too high for the current market. \u201cWe\u2019re still in that unwinding process,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s at least a couple years more clean-up work.\u201d",
        "summary": "## Venture Capital Landscape: A Tale of Two Cities\n\nDespite the post-pandemic downturn ending, fundraising remains challenging for many startups. Tribeca Venture Partners focuses on late-stage companies with lower valuations, often overlooked by other VCs. This gap is especially evident in Series B and D rounds, with AI companies attracting high valuations while non-AI companies struggle. Carta data shows a significant decline in Series A companies securing Series B funding within two years. Tribeca Ventures aims to bridge this gap by helping startups with \"pricedown rounds\" to adjust to the new market reality. This \"clean-up work\" is expected to continue for a few more years."

        "content": "A San Francisco jury has found Nima Momeni guilty of second-degree murder in the stabbing of Bob Lee, the Cash App creator and former CTO of Block, according toNBC Bay Areaon Tuesday. The jury found Momeni not guilty of first-degree murder, meaning jurors decided the murder of Lee was not premeditated. Lee wasfatally stabbedon the streets of downtown San Francisco in April 2023. During the trial, prosecutors painted a dramatic picture of Lee\u2019s two-day drug binge with Khazar Momeni, the sister of his murderer, which preceded his death. Prosecutors alleged that Lee\u2019s friend and drug dealer had sexually assaulted Khazar during the escapade, leading to a heated exchange in which Nima ultimately stabbed Lee with a kitchen knife from his sister\u2019s home. However, the defense told a different story. Nima Momeni told the jury he was out on a walk with Lee under the Bay Bridge on the night of the stabbing, trying to convince Lee to spend more time at home with his family instead of out partying. The defense alleged that Lee became frustrated and attacked Momeni with a knife during that conversation, leading Momeni to retaliate in self-defense and grab the weapon from Lee. Momeni told jurors he had no animosity toward Lee. However, video evidence of the event indicated that Momeni was the aggressor, and forensic testing found Momeni\u2019s DNA on the knife\u2019s handle. The punishment for first-degree murder is often harsher than the punishment for second-degree murder, but both typically come with lengthy prison sentences. Momeni is facing 16 years to life in prison, with sentencing to come at a later date. Lee was 43 and the chief product officer at the cryptocurrency company MobileCoin at the time of his death. Prior to that, he led technology development at Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block, where he created the mobile payment service Cash App, and was also an investor in SpaceX, Clubhouse, Tile, and Figma. In his early 20s, he helped develop the Android operating system at Google. At the time of Lee\u2019s death, his colleagues and peers praised his contributions to the technology world. The CEO of Figma, Dylan Field, noted howLee first met with him when he was 14and was an early supporter of Figma. Dorsey said Lee wasinstrumental to creating Square, which then became Block. Initially after Lee\u2019s murder, many speculated that the tech executive\u2019s death was random and related to San Francisco\u2019s homelessness and crime problem. In fact, it turned out that Lee knew the killer.",
        "summary": "Nima Momeni was found guilty of second-degree murder for stabbing Bob Lee, Cash App creator. Prosecutors argued Lee's murder followed a drug-fueled weekend with Momeni's sister, while the defense claimed it was self-defense during an argument. Video evidence and DNA linked Momeni to the crime. He faces 16 years to life in prison. Lee, a tech leader at MobileCoin, Block, and other companies, was 43."

According to its founders, Juicyway racked up these numbers with no publicly available app or marketing efforts \u2014 and instead relied heavily on word-of-mouth referrals. One customer type for a cross-border payments platform would be a remittance business, but Juicyway is representative of a new wave of platforms powered by stablecoin technology that challenges the conventional methods across developed and emerging markets.
