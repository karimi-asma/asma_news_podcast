        "content": "A startup out of Turkey that has built a hit casual mobile game where you have to find cats inWhere\u2019s Wally-style drawings of increasing complexity has now found something else: $18 million in funding.Agave Games, the creator of Find the Cat, will be using the Series A to build out its team and to work on future titles, starting with at least two more in the next year. The funding comes at a time when casual mobile games \u2014 word puzzles, physical puzzles, number puzzles, farm-building, and the rest \u2014 continue to rake in huge audiences and revenues. Find the Cat crossed 10 million downloads in its first quarter of life (it was only released in August). \u201cIt\u2019s the next Tripledot,\u201d said one investor, referring to the hit casual mobile game studio that has itself raisedtons of money at a big valuation. Felix Capital and Balderton Capital are co-leading this round, with E2VC participating. All three firms were already investors: Balderton had also led Agave\u2019s seed round, which happened to have Akin Babayigit, co-founder of Tripledot Studios, as an investor. Agave has now raised $25.5 million, and its post-money valuation is in the region of around $100 million. Turkey is fast becoming home to a lot of the biggest game startups in a trend started by Peak Games, which Zynga acquired for $1.8 billion in 2020. Peak\u2019s alums then went on to form Dream Games, which lastraised $255 million, Tripledot, and Spyke, which raised $50 million earlier this year (it hadlaunched with $55 million in fundingbefore releasing even a single title). Unlike the others, Agave is only a Peak offshoot in the indirect sense: CEO Alper Oner had moved to the U.S. to study computer engineering at UC Berkeley, and he stayed in the Bay Area working and trying to figure out what he wanted to focus on. \u201cI knew I wanted to be in the tech business,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the time, the Turkish ecosystem just wasn\u2019t very big.\u201d Back then, Peak was growing fast, but beyond that, there was e-commerce and not a whole lot more, he said. Then COVID-19 hit, and Oner decided to return home, where he came together with his high school friends Ali Baran Terzioglu, Burak Kar and Oguzhan Merdivenli, and they started talking about what they could build together. They hit on casual games partly because of their own interests as gamers and partly because they could see how it could bring together what they understood and knew about tech. It\u2019s also a mark of just how much tighter the formula for making casual games has become: Agave had published only one other game before Find the Cat, a puzzle game called Wonder Link. It\u2019s a flop compared to their second try, with downloads in the hundreds of thousands since its release in July 2023. Compare that to the stories you hear of Rovio\u2019s early days: it made51 games\u2014 all flops \u2014 before finally hitting the bonanza with Angry Birds. Find the Cat is very much a product of all that has come before, as well as what is around the corner. Similar to other casual games, it leans both into in-app purchases and in-app advertising (it uses AppLovin, likemany others) to make money. On Android alone, it has now netted $10 million in revenues, perSensorTowerestimates. Oner said the company uses AI a lot in the creative process: In the past, the company would have had five or six artists working on a single screen (one of the pictures in which 20 or 30 cats are hidden). Now, he said that the company is using AI to make the initial pictures, and humans are then coming in to \u201cpolish it.\u201d The company is not using AI for coding, he said, because nothing has proven to be as effective as humans on this front. But you can imagine how Agave might build more AI-fueled personalization into the mix over time. Polish seems to be the word of the moment. Rob Moffat, the partner who led the investment for Balderton, said he believes Agave has the potential to be a $100 million revenue company, partly because of how sticky gameplay is so far in Find the Cat, and partly because of other encouraging signals. \u201cThey\u2019re building this really strong team working on a bunch of interesting concepts, finding these interesting mechanics for games and making them into a really polished, fun experience. We are backing the capability they\u2019ve built to be able to do that,\u201d he said.",
        "summary": "Agave Games, the Turkish company behind the hit mobile game Find the Cat, has raised $18 million in Series A funding. The company plans to use the funds to expand its team and develop new games. Agave's success comes as casual mobile games continue to be popular with users and generate significant revenue. Find the Cat reached over 10 million downloads in its first quarter and generated $10 million in revenue on Android alone. The game uses AI to assist with the creation of the intricate illustrations where players have to find cats. Agave plans on incorporating even more AI-powered features in future games, with a goal to become a $100 million revenue company."

        "content": "Tyme Group, a South African fintech, has secured $250 million in a Series D round, pushing its valuation to $1.5 billion. The funding was led by Nu Holdings, which owns Latin America\u2019s most valuable fintech NuBank, investing $150 million for a 10% stake. M&G Catalyst Fund invested $50 million, while existing shareholders provided the remaining $50 million. Founded in 2019, Tyme Group operates a hybrid digital banking model that combines online banking with physical service touchpoints. The Singaporean-headquartered Tyme focuses on building and scaling digital banks in emerging markets by offering checking and savings accounts with debit cards, credit via buy now, pay later schemes, and cash advances. It says it has 15 million customers across its two markets of South Africa and the Philippines. Its South African brand, TymeBank, has 10 million users and has been a key driver of its growth. It has 5 million users of its Philippine brand, GoTyme, which it launched in 2022 in partnership with local conglomerate Gokongwei Group to enter Asia. Tyme claims it has raised over $400 million in customer deposits and extended more than $600 million in financing to small businesses across both markets. The fintech plans to expand further into Vietnam and Indonesia next year. Tyme, founded by chairman Coen Jonker, remains majority-owned by Patrice Motsepe\u2019s African Rainbow Capital (ARC), which retains a 40% stake in the company. The funding round, which takes Tyme\u2019s total capital raised to nearly $600 million, marks a notable recovery in investor interest in fintechs after a slowdown caused partly by rising interest rates across the world. Tyme joinsNigeria\u2019s Moniepointas one of the few African fintechs to achieve unicorn status this year. Tyme is eyeing an IPO in New York by 2028, with plans for a secondary listing in South Africa, according to Jonker. ForNubank, its investment in Tyme aligns with its broader strategy to diversify geographically and tap into the growth potential of emerging markets outside Latin America. While Nubank has cemented itself asa dominant playerin Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, with over 100 million customers, its core markets are becoming increasingly competitive as rivals like Neon and C6 Bank vie for market share. \u201cSince the beginning of Nubank, we have believed that the future of financial services globally is of digitally-native companies. We have met dozens of teams across different geographies, and we think that Tyme Group is extremely well-positioned to be one of the digital bank leaders in Africa and South East Asia. We are excited to work with Tyme to share many of our learnings of scaling this model to hundreds of millions of customers,\u201d says David V\u00e9lez, founder and CEO of Nubank. Tyme isn\u2019t Nubank\u2019s first deal outside Latin America. In 2021, the Brazilian fintechinvested in the Indian neobank Jupiter.",

        "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/16/hexa-the-startup-studio-behind-aircall-and-swan-unveils-its-next-batch-of-startups/",
        "content": "Hexa, a Paris-based startup studio that has launched dozens of B2B software companies, is sharing a list of its next batch of projects that are soon going to become independent startups. Hexa originallystarted its life in 2011 as eFounders, a startup studio focused on B2B software-as-a-service products. Hexa usually comes up with the ideas that will serve as the basis for new companies. The Hexa team then tries to match the right founding team with its new projects so that they can make them their own. Over the first year or so, Hexa\u2019s internal team helps the founders when it comes to product design, go-to-market strategy, hiring, and fundraising. When a startup raises its first funding round, it typically becomes a proper independent company. In exchange for the first year of investment and iteration, Hexa keeps a 30% stake in its portfolio companies after this funding round. While it might seem like a steep fee, Hexa\u2019s track record speaks for itself. Over the years, Hexa has spawned a handful of unicorns, such asFront,Aircall, andSpendesk, as well as some promising tech startups that could soon become unicorns, such asSwanandYouSign. And these companies are generating significant revenue too. According to Thibaud Elzi\u00e8re, Hexa\u2019s co-founder and CEO, over the next two years, at least five of the startups launched before 2021 will generate between \u20ac100 million and \u20ac300 million in annual revenue. Of course, some companies never really took off, but that\u2019s how startups work. Overall, Hexa has launched 44 companies. The startup studio itself raised a $22 millionfunding roundin 2023. While Hexa wanted tomorphinto a house of startup accelerators with each accelerator focusing on one vertical in particular, Hexa has sort of pulled back from this strategy. The company is still slowly adding new verticals with new projects around healthcare, artificial intelligence, and open source software. But you\u2019ll no longer find pages about 3founders for web3 startups or Logic Founders for fintech products on Hexa\u2019s website. Everything is a Hexa project now. Annetteisn\u2019ta B2B software company. The company is focused on helping you lose weight if your body mass index is above 30, or if you\u2019ve been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Annette\u2019s service is designed to complement GLP-1 medication, such as Wegovy or Mounjaro, with an app that lets you track your progress as well as talk with dieticians and medical experts. The idea is to maximize long-term results with a tech-augmented program. Basaltis a very 2024 startup. While everybody on LinkedIn says that prompt engineers are the next big job, Basalt is the tool that is going to be used day in, day out by people writing prompts for large language models. After writing your first prompts, you can test them with multiple models, see the results, and improve your prompts using AI. Given that AI is fuzzy tech, a prompt that used to work could stop working with a model update. So that could lead to recurring usage. Basalt competes withWorkflowAI. DermaScan is another example of Hexa branching out and venturing into new industries. The startup\u2019s name is very self-explanatory, as DermaScan will help you scan your skin regularly for potential skin cancer. This isn\u2019t just a software play; DermaScan plans to open care centers focused on skin screenings with some proprietary technology. Given that it\u2019s harder to get an appointment with a dermatologist than a magician, France seems like a good market for this startup. Smartphones have changed everything for field sales representatives. They can check their schedule, access product databases, and process orders on the go. This new startup, currently called FieldX, aims to help reps spend less time on admin tasks using a voice interface. Instead of swiping between different apps, they could use this voice-first assistant as a copilot. LegalX, another startup that doesn\u2019t have a definitive name just yet, is entering the crowded market of companies building an AI product for law firms. The biggest law firms usually rely on a small army of interns to sift through thousands of pages, annotate documents, and prepare drafts. Large language models are a good way to extract information from big blocks of text (even though they hallucinate from time to time). So it makes sense to build a product around artificial intelligence applied to these lengthy legal documents. If you\u2019ve told your company that you want to buy a subscription to a product because it\u2019ll improve your team\u2019s work, chances are the purchasing department immediately asked aboutSOC 2 certification. It usually means that the product is secure and handles data properly. OpenCertiX is going to be an open source alternative to SOC 2 compliance platforms, such asVantaorDrata. As an open source product, OpenCertiX plans to offer more certifications beyond SOC 2. Rekiis a startup offering a product to other startups \u2014\u00a0and beyond. When you create a startup in France, you can unlock some non-dilutive financing to help you get started \u2014 think \u201cCr\u00e9dit d\u2019Imp\u00f4ts Recherche\u201d or \u201cBourse French Tech.\u201d But for some industry-specific grants, it can be hard to know if your company fits the criteria. Moreover, putting together an application can be a time-consuming process without any guarantee that it\u2019s going to work. Reki helps you gather documents, create an application, and send it so that it only takes you hours, not days. And, of course, the company is using AI to generate the application automatically. SleepX is going to offer a sleep-related personalized healthcare program. Specifically designed for women struggling with insomnia, SleepX will combine Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) with data on hormonal, biological, and psychological factors. Details are thin on what the product is going to look like. But given that ads for sleeping pills are everywhere, the market opportunity is significant. StandardX is an AI startup focused on customer support via phone. Many companies now let you state your issue so that you don\u2019t have to press 1, then 3, then 4 to reach the right customer support department. But these voice recognition products don\u2019t really change the overall experience for people on the line. StandardX will likely use all the buzzy AI technologies to overhaul these conversations \u2014 think speech-to-text, LLM, and text-to-speech \u2014 combined with ERP data. But we\u2019ll have to wait to learn more about the product. Tandemis another customer support startup. But this time, it\u2019s all about helping users set up their account and data when trying out a new tool. Onboarding remains a key topic among software-as-a-startup founders. That\u2019s why Tandem plans to use AI to facilitate onboarding with personalized tips. As a benefit, the support team will receive less support tickets. It has the potential to becomeClippy, but actually useful.",

This will be thefinalTechCrunch Space newsletter you receive in 2024, so to all our readers, have a wonderful holiday and see you next year. There\u2019s a lot to look forward to next year. I expect to see much more progress from SpaceX on Starship, big changes to NASA under the leadership of incoming administrator Jared Isaacman, Rocket Lab\u2019s Neutron debut, and big missions for Impulse Space, Varda, and dozens of other startups. It will also be interesting to see if rumors prove true with Boeing selling off its space business. That would truly mark a new world order. In terms of venture financing, I expect to see more recovery from the lows in the 2023 time span, and if Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency does even a fraction of what it proposes, that could significantly loosen the regulatory and bureaucratic environment in which infrastructure-heavy industries (like space) operate. The downstream effects could be seen very quickly. Want to reach out with a tip? Email Aria ataria.techcrunch@gmail.comor send a message on Signal at 512-937-3988.

Speaking of regulations, it was nice to get an update from Blue Origin last week on the inaugural New Glenn launch, with the company essentially saying that the only puzzle pieces to fit into place are regulatory approvals for the rocket\u2019s hot fire test and launch. With scarcely two weeks left of the year, it is absolutely feasible that New Glenn still launches in 2024, but a lot will depend on how the hot fire test goes. The turnaround time will be tight\u2026  Late-stage deals in space have been on the decline this year, so it was exciting to see the announcement fromFleet Space Technologiesthat it had closed a $100 million Series D.\u00a0The Adelaide, Australia-based startup has developed a technology stack to enable mineral prospecting from space \u2014 and identifying critical mineral deposits will be key in a future that heavily relies on them (i.e. identifying lithium for batteries).
